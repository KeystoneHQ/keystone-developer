# Keystone Developer

**The Keystone hardware wallet is simply relaunched from the Cobo Vault branding 
so both the code base and infrastructure are almost the same. 
For more info please checkout [here](https://blog.keyst.one/leaving-cobo-to-continue-the-cobo-vault-legacy-29bb2f8f026e).**

Keystone is an air-gapped, open source hardware wallet that uses completely transparent QR code data transmissions.
