# Polkadot

The `KeystoneSDK` doesn't have the implementation of Polkadot support.

You can use [@polkadot/react-qr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/react-qr) to
communication with Keystone hardware wallet as Keystone Hardware wallet follows 
the [Universal Offline Signatures](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/uos) standard.
